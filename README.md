# MineRL Research Project Proposal [v1]

## Overview
This project is focused on the exploration and understanding of existing deep learning models, particularly in the realm of reinforcement learning (RL), within the complex, multi-task environment of Minecraft as provided by the MineRL dataset and competition framework. By studying current models and their performance in Minecraft, I aim to identify opportunities for improvements through fine-tuning techniques to adapt these models to perform new or more specialized tasks within the game environment.

## Objectives
1. **Study of Existing Models**: Conduct a comprehensive review of current deep learning models that have been applied to the MineRL environment, focusing on their methodologies, strengths, and limitations.
2. **Fine-Tuning and Adaptation**: Apply fine-tuning techniques to existing models to improve their performance on specific tasks in the MineRL dataset, demonstrating the potential for model adaptation.
3. **Implementation of a Fine-Tuned Model**: Implement a fine-tuned version of an existing model to achieve better performance or to tackle a new task within the MineRL environment, showcasing the versatility and adaptability of current AI technologies.
4. **Evaluation and Comparison**: Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model against its original version, highlighting the improvements and discussing the effectiveness of fine-tuning strategies in model adaptation.

## Background
MineRL offers a challenging platform for AI research, with a diverse range of tasks from resource collection to combat and exploration. This project will dive into existing AI models that have been explored within this environment, aiming to understand their design and identify potential areas for enhancement through fine-tuning.

## Methodology
1. **Literature Review**: Begin with a thorough literature review to identify existing models that have been tested or developed for the MineRL environment.
2. **Model Selection**: Select one or more models that show promise for improvement or adaptation to new tasks within Minecraft.
3. **Fine-Tuning Process**: Apply fine-tuning techniques, adjusting model parameters and training approaches to enhance model performance on specific MineRL tasks.
4. **Implementation and Testing**: Implement the fine-tuned models within the MineRL environment and conduct extensive testing to evaluate performance improvements.
5. **Analysis and Reporting**: Analyze the results, comparing the performance of the fine-tuned models to their original versions, and prepare a detailed report on the findings.

## Expected Outcomes
Main objective:
- A detailed analysis of existing AI models within the MineRL context, identifying key areas for potential improvements.

Challenge objective:
- A successfully fine-tuned model that demonstrates enhanced performance on specific tasks in MineRL, compared to its original version.
- A comprehensive report documenting the fine-tuning process, model performance comparisons, and insights gained from adapting existing models to new tasks.
